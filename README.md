# Wireless-Tracker-Project
This project, done for the course ESC204 (Praxis III: Engineering Design), consists of building a prototype of a physical tracking device (Fusion360 CAD, 3D Printing) using GPS location with wireless data transfer (TCP/IP &amp; SPI protocols) controlled by microcontrollers (Arduino Nano, Raspberry Pi Pico) programmed in MicroPython/CircuitPython.
